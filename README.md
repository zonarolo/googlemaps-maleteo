Before to start you need to create in the project directory a JS file for your API key of google that I named
 "credentials.js", you can see the import in App.js. 

##Installation

You will need to install supercluster as a peer dependency of this package.

###`yarn add supercluster use-supercluster`

----------------------------------------------------
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
